Ebook organizer and reader - cross-platform dev practice.

# Dependencies
[Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/) for sure (I'm building this on 5.16.0 stable). This is also needed to run the executable in linux.

Also, if you plan on developing with this, you will want to check with your distro package and grab gtk-sharp3 (or any of the -sharp varieties there).

Once this comes along a little further, I'll do a more throrough dependency check.

# More Documentation
I'll get to this. Fucking tired.
